### Steps to connect and run UI(HTML) with backend(SmartContracts)

1. Need hardhat network address (hardhat node)
2. Need to be on hardhat network via meta-mask
3. Need some amount in the account so can connect hardhat accounts to the meta-mask using the private key.
4. If the nonce error that means the metamask and hardhat nodes are not in sync with each other, simply reset the account to resolve the problem.
